# MCQ-Maker-Fullstack
Frontend of the MCQ-Maker web app


## Overview

MCQ-Maker enables you to create a multiple-choice exam and share the link with anyone to take the test. The owner of the MCQ can then view the submissions, along with the names of the persons and their marks.

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   cd your-project-directory
   ```

2. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vite-react-tailwind.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd vite-react-tailwind
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The server supports hot module replacement for a smooth development experience.
   Make sure to start the server on local host 5173
